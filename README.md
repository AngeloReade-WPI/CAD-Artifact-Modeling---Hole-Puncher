# CAD-Artifact-Modeling---Hole-Puncher
Used SolidWorks to create a 1:1 functional replica of a 2 prong hole puncher
 The project included:
 
-Precision part modeling using parametric sketches and feature based design to accurately reflect design intent

-Kinematic assembly containing various mates to simulate real world motion

-Motion analysis and animation using motion studies

- Fully annotated ANSI formatted engineering drawings for manufacturing

Skills learned: Solidworks, parametric design, mechanical system modeling,technical documentation

Final Grade: 100
