# Hole Puncher CAD Assembly

## Overview
This project is a fully modeled 1-1 two pronghole puncher assembly designed in CAD with multiple moving components.
The goal was to create a mechanically accurate model that clearly demonstrates part relationships,
motion, and manufacturability.

## My Role
- Designed and modeled all components
- Assembled parts with correct constraints
- Verified motion of the punching mechanism
- Organized files for clarity and reuse
- Create part and engineering drawings for manufacturability (ANSI Metric standard)
- Create a motion picture demonstrating proper constraints and movement

## Tools & Skills
- Solidworks suite
- Parametric modeling
- Design for manufacturability
- Basic FEA

## Key Features
- Multi-part assembly with moving linkage
- Realistic motion of punch mechanism
- Clean part hierarchy and naming
- Dimensioned and constrained components

## Files
This repository contains:
- Assembly files
- Animation 
- Detailed drawings
- Supporting design artifacts
